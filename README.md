# Project Endeavour

This is the project for testing out my new game ideas.

Endeavour has always been my codeword for an open-world RPG that is one giant simulation. The core idea that I want to explore and develop is a world that lives and breathes. This means having an AI that feels real. It means having a world where your actions are permanent, where your actions have realistic effects. If you drop a bucket of water onto the floor of a shop, the shop-keeper gets confused + angry as to why you are trying to flood his shop. Think Dwarf-Fortress-esque levels of simulation. This will be backed by a world in which you can change as you see fit. Minecraft-style world editing but with arbitrary volumetric terrain/objects, not just cubes. Realistic weather and fluid simulation, physics and destruction, and creative freedom are some of the end-goals. Also in my mind is a realistic chemistry/geology system, where ores and minerals are realistically placed in the world through a procedural geology simulation, and then to refine and use these ores/minerals you have to mine, clean, refine, smelt and perform other chemical processes on them to make them useable. This will lead to an automation-like game like Factorio, which is one of the game inpiritations I am using.

It uses Monogame and C# for rapid prototyping, and any eventual games will be rewritten using C++ and OpenGL/Vulkan.

# Project Endeavour

This is the project for testing out my new game ideas.

Endeavour has always been my codeword for an open-world RPG that is one giant simulation. The core idea that I want to explore and devlop is a world that lives and breathes. This means having an AI that feels real. It means having a world where your actions are permanent, where your actions have realistic effects. If you drop a bucket of water onto the floor of a shop, the shop-keeper gets confused + angry as to why you are trying to flood his shop. Think Dwarf-Fortress-esque levels of simulation. This will be backed by a world in which you can change as you see fit. Minecraft-style world editing but with arbitrary volumetric terrain/objects, not just cubes. Realistic weather and fluid simulation, physics and destruction, and creative freedom are some of the end-goals.

It uses Monogame and C# for rapid prototyping, and any eventual games will be rewritten using C++ and OpenGL/Vulkan.
